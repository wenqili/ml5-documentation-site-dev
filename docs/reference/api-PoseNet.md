PoseNet is a machine learning model that allows for [Real-time Human Pose Estimation](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5).

PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.

The original PoseNet model was ported to TensorFlow.js by Dan Oved. Check out his [blog post](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5).

## Example

```javascript
const video = document.getElementById("video");

// Create a new poseNet method
const poseNet = ml5.poseNet(video, modelLoaded);

// When the model is loaded
function modelLoaded() {
  console.log("Model Loaded!");
}
// Listen to new 'pose' events
poseNet.on("pose", function(results) {
  poses = results;
});
```

[Here](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/blob/master/p5js/PoseNet/sketch.js) is a complete example.

## Syntax

```javascript
ml5.poseNet(?video, ?type, ?callback)
```

```javascript
ml5.poseNet(?video, ?options, ?callback)
```

```javascript
ml5.poseNet(?callback, ?options)
```

### Parameters

- `video` - Optional. A HTML video element or a p5 video element.
- `type` - Optional. A String value to run 'single' or 'multiple' estimation.
- `callback` - Optional. A function to run once the model has been loaded. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has loaded.
- `options` - Optional. An object describing a model accuracy and performance. The available parameters are:

```
{
 imageScaleFactor: 0.3,
 outputStride: 16,
 flipHorizontal: false,
 minConfidence: 0.5,
 maxPoseDetections: 5,
 scoreThreshold: 0.5,
 nmsRadius: 20,
 detectionType: 'single',
 multiplier: 0.75,
}
```

For more information about these options please refer to the [original PoseNet code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet)

## Properties

```javascript
.detectionType
```

> The type of detection. 'single' or 'multiple'

## Methods

```javascript
.singlePose(?input)
```

```javascript
.multiPose(?input)
```

> Given an image or video, returns an array of objects containing pose estimations using single or multi-pose detection

`input` - A HTML video or image element or a p5 image or video element. If no input is provided, the default is to use the video given in the constructor.

## Event Listeners

```javascript
.on('pose', function(results){
  console.log(results);
})
```

> Triggers every time there's a new pose detected. If you create a new poseNet method with a video element, this Event Listener will be called continuously over the video frames. Returns an array of objects containing pose estimations using single detection
