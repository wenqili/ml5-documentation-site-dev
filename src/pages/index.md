    ml5.js aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists,
    creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms
    and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies.



description: >-
  The library is supported by code examples, tutorials, and sample datasets with an emphasis on ethical computing.
  Bias in data, stereotypical harms, and responsible crowdsourcing are part of the documentation around data collection
  and usage.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
