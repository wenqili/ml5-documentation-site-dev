  title: Why ml5.js?
  description: >
    ml5.js aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists,
    creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms
    and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies.

description: >-
  The library is supported by code examples, tutorials, and sample datasets with an emphasis on ethical computing.
  Bias in data, stereotypical harms, and responsible crowdsourcing are part of the documentation around data collection
  and usage.
