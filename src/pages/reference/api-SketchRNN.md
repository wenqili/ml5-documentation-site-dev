SketchRNN is a recurrent neural network model trained on millions of doodles collected from the [Quick, Draw! game](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/). The SketchRNN model can create new drawings (from a list of categories) based on an initial path.

This original paper and implementation of SketchRNN was made in TensorFlow and ported to [Magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/get-started/#magenta-js) by [David Ha](https://twitter.com/hardmaru). The ml5.js implementation was ported by [Reiichiro Nakano](https://github.com/reiinakano).

The ml5 library includes [a list of supported SketchRNN models](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/blob/master/src/SketchRNN/models.js).

## Example

```javascript
// Create a new SketchRNN Instance
const model = ml5.SketchRNN("cat", modelReady);

// When the model is loaded
function modelReady() {
  console.log("SketchRNN Model Loaded!");
}
// Reset the model's current stat
model.reset();
// Generate a new stroke
model.generate(gotSketch);

function gotSketch(err, result) {
  // Do something with the result
}
```

Here is [a complete example](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/blob/master/p5js/SketchRNN/sketch.js).

## Syntax

```javascript
ml5.SketchRNN(model, ?callback)
```

### Parameters

`model` - The name of the model to use.

`callback` - Optional. A function to be called once the model is loaded. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has loaded.

## Properties

```javascript
.ready
```

> Boolean value that specifies if the model has loaded.

## Methods

```javascript
.reset()
```

> Reset the model's current state

```javascript
.generate(?seed, ?options, ?callback)
```

> Generates a new sample with the current state.

`seed` - Optional. A seed to be passed to the model before generating a new stroke.

`options` - Optional. An object describing the options of the model.

`callback` - Optional. A function that will return a generated stroke. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved with a generated stroke.
